# TODO Which SBOMs should I  use and where can I find them?

- Paper for the SBOMs: [Wild SBOMs: a Large-scale Dataset of Software Bills of Materials from Public Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15021)
- [Actual dataset on zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14250103)
- I decided to chose all CycloneDX SBOMs containing at least one dependency at Cargo -> 25
